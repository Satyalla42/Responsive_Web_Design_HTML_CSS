Welcome to the Human Universal Energy training program, founded in 1989.
I am Robert Fitz and I am a certified trainer. Please explore our <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.hue-faculty.com/en/about-us/">homepage</a> if you are interested in our history.</p>
<p id="tribute-info">This method, at its basic level, is based on the “opening” (activation) of 6 chakras (wheel or circle in Sanskrit), which are the energy centers of our body. The opening of chakras enables us to harness the spiritual energy more effectively and transfer it to our body or to another person. The flow of Universal Energy in the body will help the person’s (both the practitioner of HUE and the other person) energy system regain its balance promoting an overall state of harmony between body and soul.</p>

<p id="tribute-info">Students enrolled in the HUE Training program learn that everything exists as Energy.</p>

<p id="tribute-info">The authentic training program in Human Universal Energy ® consists of 4 levels (Basic-, Intermediate-, Advanced-, and Specialized-) with a total number of 8 seminar units (01 HUE to 08 HUE, former Level 1 – Level 20).</p>

<p id="tribute-info">After completion of the 01 HUE Basic Level, students can continue with the other levels in the HUE Program. Additionally, HUE Students can further develop spiritually by enrolling in the HUE Development courses offered. Moreover, students have the opportunity for individual coaching on the HUE Training program.</p>

The officially recognized HUE Facilitators are certified, trained and licensed by HUE FACULTY, Inc.
